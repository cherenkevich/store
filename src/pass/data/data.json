        "description": "<p>I wanted to&nbsp;have one foot in&nbsp;the sea and the&nbsp;other in&nbsp;civilization. So&nbsp;Fiumicino seemed like the&nbsp;perfect spot to&nbsp;stay&nbsp;— until I&nbsp;realized getting to&nbsp;Rome from there without a&nbsp;60-euro taxi was nearly impossible. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;end, we spent as&nbsp;much on&nbsp;rides between the city and the coast as&nbsp;we&nbsp;could have on&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight to&nbsp;another warm country...</p><p>But inspiration is priceless. One evening in&nbsp;Rome, I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;restaurant with a&nbsp;wall full of&nbsp;black-and-white street photos. That’s when it clicked: if&nbsp;I&nbsp;were ever to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;black-and-white zine, this was the place for&nbsp;it. Rome’s character isn’t in&nbsp;its colors but&nbsp;in&nbsp;its light and&nbsp;shadows, in&nbsp;the way the&nbsp;city moves and breathes. So&nbsp;here it&nbsp;is&nbsp;— my Rome, raw and&nbsp;timeless, captured in&nbsp;black and&nbsp;white.</p>",

In this issue I want to tell about the city itself. </p><p>Last time I was in Paris in 2013. And since then, it’s like I’ve been preparing for the next trip. I have been into the Impressionists, Marc Chagall, Chaim Soutine, the French New Wave. But the trip was short and I didn’t have time to dedicate it to my icons. Instead I just walked around the city, filmed a lot and was hanging out in record stores. </p><p>I would like to have a couple more photos in this issue — with a view of the Barbès—Rochechouart bridge, which I passed one night. But then I preferred to hold the camera to myself and walk as quickly as possible past the burning barrels while the local guys shouted me “Le pigeon! Le pigeon!”.</p>",

After that we canceled our tickets to Prague and stayed in Warsaw for a few more days to attend the Varušniak party. Varušniak is a concert and techno rave made by belarusian musicians and promoters. Highly recommended!</p><p>Usually at the end of any issue I list my favorite places in the city. This time I want to dedicate not just one spread, but the whole zine to bars and restaurants in Warsaw, which were opened by my friends from Belarus.</p>",
